Given a digitized stream centerline and a set of input x,y         coordinates. This software will transform the input x,y coordinates into a curvalinear coordinate system based on the stream centerline. This stream normal coordinate system is:
- **ds** - a downstream distance (from the most upstream point)
- **xs** - a cross-stream distance (an orthogonal distance to the centerline along the normal vector)
